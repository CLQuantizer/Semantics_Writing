## what is neo-davidsonian
Davidsonian is A cluster of theories of relations, their arugments and their modifiers

## Neo davidsonian: 
Higginbotham and Parsons 1990, radically assuming that:
all-verbs, non-statives and statives alike, have such an implicit argument - verb are not relations, but one-place predicates of events, and it assumes that both modifiers and arguments are added conjunctively,
Landman, 2000, p.2 

## what are the rivals of neo-davidsonian

## Parsons, 1990
Simple sentences of English contain subatomic quantification over events.

## What are the three theories of scope and plurality?
Lakoff 1970 QL

**SQI: scopal quantifying-in**
**DQI: distributive quantifying-in**
**NQI: non-scopal quantifying-in**
**Event type:**

**Theory S and Theory D:**
**Theory D reduces Distributivity to Scope**
**Theory S reduces Distributivity to Plurality**

**SM: scopal meaning**
**ST: storage**
**Existential closure**
